# Configurable Button

Create a `Button` component

1. Button component takes three props
    - `to` destination the button will take you to
    - `type` type of element, button, input, anchor link
    - `value` text to show for the button
1. Depending on the props passed, the `Button` component will render appropriate button

1. Extra credit: Pass `class props` to style the button as well
